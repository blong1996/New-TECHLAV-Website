						                    Dr. Edward Tunstel is a senior roboticist in the Research &amp;
						                    Exploratory Development Department of JHU/APL. He has served
						                    as space robotics &amp; autonomous control lead in the Space
						                    Department. He joined JHU/APL in 2007 after 18 years at NASA
						                    JPL, where he was a senior robotics engineer and group
						                    leader of its Advanced Robotic Controls Group. He earned his
						                    bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering
						                    from Howard University and his PhD in electrical engineering
						                    from the University of New Mexico. 
						                    Dr.Tunstel maintains expertise in robotics and intelligent
						                    systems with current research interests in mobile robot
						                    navigation, autonomous control, cooperative robotics,
						                    robotic systems engineering and soft computing applications
						                    to autonomous systems. He has authored over 130 technical
						                    publications and co-edited four books in these areas. He
						                    worked on the NASA Mars Exploration Rovers mission as both a
						                    flight systems engineer responsible for autonomous surface
						                    navigation and as rover engineering team lead for the
						                    mobility and robotic arm subsystems. He was involved in the
						                    daily performance assessment, planning, and operations of
						                    the Spirit and opportunity rovers during their first four
						                    years on Mars. He is now engaged in modular open systems
						                    development efforts supporting the Navy's Advanced EOD
						                    Robotic Systems program, as well as robotics and autonomy
						                    research for future national security and space
						                    applications. Dr. Tunstel is an IEEE Fellow and a member of
						                    AIAA and NSBE-Alumni Extension.

				                      Electro-Optics from Arizona State University (ASU) at
				                      Tempe Arizona in 1980. He received an MBA from New Mexico
				                      Highland University (NMHU) in 1986 and his PhD in Linear
				                      Systems Theory from University of New Mexico in 1994.
				                      After graduating from NMSU as an Electrical Engineer, he
				                      moved to Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan and worked for
				                      Motorola. Shortly after graduating from ASU, he moved to
